# Array - Summary
This Document Contains Summary of Array Module which i completed.


## General Points
* Time is profitable than space. (**TIME > SPACE**)
* Can it be done in one loop (**Two Pointer Approach**) ?


### From n<sup>2</sup> to n\*log(n) 
* Check if **Sorting** can Actually Benefit or not.
* Don't just think of Sorting, if there is kinda comparison involved, check if a group can be compared to other and can result be derived from it ? if Yes **Merge Sort** Can Be Beneficial.

e.g: [Count Inversion](./15_count_inversions.cpp), [Merge Intervals](./13_merge_intervals.cpp) 


### From n<sup>2</sup> to n
* Instead of Considering Brute Force, Try using **Hashmap or Unordered Map or Frequency Counting**.
* Try to **Identify Pattern**.
* Try to **think in Pythonic way**, instead off cpp {Trust me, will be way more beneficial}

e.g: [Subarray sum zero](./20_subarray_sum_zero.cpp), [Max Product Subarray](./22_max_product_subarray.cpp)


### From n to log(n)
* Think of Binary Search, Can it be Applied ?, How Can i Apply it Here ?

e.g: [Median Sorted Array](./35_median_sorted_array.cpp)

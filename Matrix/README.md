# Matrix - Summary
This Document Contains Summary of Matrix Module which i completed.


## General Points
* If sometime you can't thing of any method, searching in domain may help (Can be Binary Search to Decrease Cmplexity).

e.g - [Kth Row Wise Sorted](./02_median_row_wise_sorted.cpp)


## Sorted Matrix
* Is Matrix Sorted in Both Columns and Rows ? [Check if you can start from any corner and reach to desired Result]
* Is Matrix Sorted, Row wise or Column Wise ? [You can obviously use (Binary Search) property]

e.g: [Search In Matrix](./01_search_matrix.cpp), [Median Row Wise Sorted](./02_median_row_wise_sorted.cpp)


### From n<sup>4</sup> to n<sup>2</sup>
* Check if some preprocessing or condition mentioned can benefit or not.

e.g: [Find Specific Pair](./06_find_specific_pair.cpp)
